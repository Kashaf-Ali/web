    <blockquote><p style="font-size:160%;">Jaun was very particular about language. While his diction is rooted in the classical tradition, he
        touches on new subjects. He remained in quest of an ideal all his life. Unable to find the ideal eventually, he
        became angry and frustrated. He felt, perhaps with reason, that he had squandered his talent.</blockquote></p>
    <p>In 2020, Punjabi rapper Kay Kap's album Rough Rhymes for Tough Times featured a song entitled Bulaava which had
        couplets from the poem Pehnaayi Ka Makaan written and recited by Jaun Elia.</p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size:160%;">In 2020, Pakistani rock-fusion band Nishtar Park released a single Purane Aur Naye Sawal which was based on
        Elia's ghazal Umr Guzaregi Imtihan Mein Kya.</p>
    <p style="font-size:160%;">n 2023, Urdu rapper Talha Anjum’s album Open Letter featured a song entitled Secrets which was strongly
        influenced by Jaun Elia’s poem Be-dilli Kya Yuhin Din Guzar Jaenge. Talha Anjum’s other works are also heavily
        influenced by Jaun Elia’s poetry.</p>
